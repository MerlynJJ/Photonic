* 0.005
  1. [2016-06-12 Sun] Added INSTALL

* 0.006
  1. [2016-06-12 Sun] Add mode line to Changes to use org-mode when
     editing.
  2. Add to INSTALL
  3. Correct error in README
  4. [2016-06-16 Thu] Correct error in SYNOPSIS of Photonic.pm
  5. [2016-07-07 Thu] Add authors.
  6. Correct mistake in Types and in FieldH.
* 0.007
  1. Put authors in Build.PL
  2. Update references in README
  3. Add modules for retarded calculations.
* 0.008
  1. Added two smallness parameters, one for Haydock and one for
     continued fractions.
  2. Correct version in Wave.pm
  3. There is a logical error en EpsL and GreeP. The upper of the
     iteration was wrong, but now we can't distinguish between
     nonconvergence or using up all Haydock coefficients.
  4. Update Changes and README. Correct upper limit in iterations.
  5. Change logic of convergence tests
  6. Modified code to allow two smallness parameters
     1. Independently state criteria for Haydock coefficient
        calculations and for continued fraction convergence.
  7. Added projected wave operator and projected dielectric function
     1. This modules may be used along principal directions when the full
	matricial response is unneeded, thus saving time.
  8. The routines cgtsl and dgtsl were incorrectly imported and documented
  9. Corrected interface to the linpack routines cgtsl and dgtsl
  10. Changes to allow disttest to pass
* 0.009
  1. Changed slightly the code for second harmonic calculations. 
  2. Corrected SHG
     1. Cleaned code to run slatec routines cgtsl and dgtsl. Now they
	can be used with 4 or 6 arguments and may use inplace
	arguments. Added typemap.PL so that it creates a copy of PDL's
	typemap to be used by .pd code.
  3. Changes to the documentation fo FieldH
  4. Correct mistakes in Geometry from image2D.
  5. Deleted a couple of unneeded prints
  6. Changed calls to fortran routines
     1. I copyied arguments except when inplace since cgtsl and dgtsl
        destroy all its arguments.
     2. Changed tests to test inplace.
  7. Added documentation to shg
  8. Found convergence problems with current field
     calculation. Started exploring.
  9. Changed FieldH to use linpack
     1. instead of solving naively tridiagonal linear equation to get
        field
  10. Added code to accelerate selfconsistent longitudinal polarization.
      1. Left it commented, as it is missing the longitudinal projetor and
	 the full self consistent field
  11. Added field1 and field2 accesors and buiders to SH
      1. And eliminated now unnecessary BUILD
  12. Added to SH alternative self consistent longitudinal macroscopic
      polarization component P2LMCalt. The non alternative hasn't been
      added yet.
  13. Subtle changes in SHG. Now we obey y y<-> -y symmetry for 2D systems
      with mirror line.
* 0.010
  1. Eliminated Makefile.PL, as it is automatically built
  2. Merge branch 'bernardo'
  3. Modified SH to have finite polarizability at zero density
  4. Added Lucila's retarded field calculations
  5. Added Lucila's field calculation to the proper directory
  6. First attempt to reorthogonalize
  7. Normalize states on each step
  8. First working reorthogonalization
  9. Added flag to reorthogonalize in the old NR/AllH module
  10. removed old AllH with reorthogonalization
  11. Changed retarded calculation of b coefficient
  12. Removed some comments
  13. Allow reorthogonalization in NonRetarded::AllH and change
      normalization in Retarded and NonRetarded OneH to stabilize
      calculation.
  14. Merge branch 'reorthogonalization'
  15. Added files that Build said were missing
  16. Added travis yaml file
  17. Renamed travis yaml file
  18. Added after_failure: to look a build failure
  19. Corrected .travis.yml
  20. Add namespace::autoclean to dependencies in Build.PL
  21. Add mask to SH susceptibility
  22. Modify SHChiTensor in order to admit options
      1. The option mask takes an array of ones and zeroes to indicate
         the contributions from which regions to be taken into account.
      2. The option kind takes a letter 'f' full, 'd', dipolar or 'q',
         quadrupolar.
  23. Add modules for gyrotropy
      1. Add complex unit pairs and dyad to obtain all independent
         components        of the Green's function, the wave operator
         and the epsilon tensor for gyrotropic systems.
  24. Correct version string
      1. Correct version string in EpsilonTensorF and WaveF
  25. Add reorthogonalization to Retarded. Correct code for gyrotropic
      1. Added reorthogonalization methods to retarded calculations.
      2. Added code to save and restore haydock fields. Incomplete.
      3. Added complex conjugate unit vectors and dyads.
      4. Quite untested. Lucila's changes.
  26. Meta files, to be deleted soon
  27. Removed META files
* 0.011
  1. Change travis file
  2. Add before_install to .travis.yml
