=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Photonic::Geometry;
  use Photonic::NonRetarded::EpsTensor;

  my $g=Photonic::Geometry->new(B=>$b);
  my $eps=Photonic::Nonretarded::EpsTensor->new(geometry=>$g, nh=>$N);
  my $epsValue=$eps->evaluate($epsA, $epsB);

Calculates the dielectric tensor of a metamaterial made up of two
materials with dielectric functions $epsA and $epsB with a geometry $g
corresponding to a characteristic funcion $b and using $N Haydock
coefficients.
