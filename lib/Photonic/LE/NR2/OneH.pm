=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Photonic::LE::NR2::OneH;
    my $nr=Photonic::LE::NR2::OneH->new(geometry=>$geometry);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements calculation of Haydock coefficients and Haydock states for
the calculation of the non retarded dielectric function of arbitrary
periodic two component systems in arbitrary number of dimentions. One
Haydock coefficient at a time.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(geometry=>$g[, smallH=>$s])

Create a new Ph::LE::NR2::OneH object with GeometryG0 $g and optional
smallness parameter  $s.

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS (read only)

=over 4

=item * geometry Photonic::Types::GeometryG0

A Photonic::Geometry object defining the geometry of the system,
the charateristic function and the direction of the G=0 vector. Should
be given in the initializer.

=item * B ndims dims r G GNorm L scale f

Accesors handled by geometry (see Photonic::Roles::Geometry)

=item * smallH

A small number used as tolerance to end the iteration. Small negative
b^2 coefficients are taken to be zero.

=item * previousState currentState nextState

The n-1-th, n-th and n+1-th Haydock states; a complex number for each pixel

=item * current_a

The n-th Haydock coefficient a

=item * current_b2 next_b2 current_b next_b

The n-th and n+1-th b^2 and b Haydock coefficients

=item * iteration

Number of completed iterations

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * iterate

Performs a single Haydock iteration and updates current_a, next_b,
next_b2, next_state, shifting the current values where necessary. Returns
0 when unable to continue iterating.

=item * applyOperator($psi_G)

Apply the 'Hamiltonian' operator to state. State is
ri:nx:ny... gnorm=i:nx:ny... The operator is the longitudinal
=component of the characteristic function.

=item * innerProduct($left, $right)

Returns the inner (Hermitian) product between states.

=item * magnitude($psi)

Returns the magnitude of a state as the square root of the inner
=product of the state with itself.

=item * changesign

Return 0, as there is no need to change sign.

=back

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=over 4

item * _firstState

Returns the first state $v.
