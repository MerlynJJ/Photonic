=head1 SYNOPSYS

     use Photonic::Iterator qw(iterator nextval);
     sub makeiterator {
         my $a=shift;
         my $n=0;
         my $it = iterator {
              return $a->[$n++];
         };
         return $it;
     }
     sub makebiterator { #blessed version
         my $a=shift;
         my $n=0;
         my $it=Photonic::Iterator->new(sub {
              return $a->[$n++];
         });
         return $it;
     }
     my @a=(1..100);
     my $it=makeiterator(\@a);
     my $bit=makebiterator(\@a);
     while(my $x=nextval($it)){

     }
     while(my $x=$bit->nextval){
        #do something with $x
     }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Facilitate the creation of iterators. Iterators are objects that
produce data items, one at a time, until depleted. They are
implemented as functions (closures) that have state (implemented as
lexical variables) to know which is the next item. The example above
creates an iterator for walking over the elements of an array
reference.

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item iterator

    my $i=iterator {...}

creates an iterator from the function {...}

=item new

   my $it=Photonic::Iterator->new(sub {...});

creates a blessed iterator from the function sub {...}

=item nextval

   my $x=nextval($i)
   my $x=$i->nextval

returns the next value from iterator $i. The second form works for
blessed iterators, so you don't have to import the function nextval.

version 0.011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Photonic::Iterator qw(iterator nextval);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Iterator is an object interface to a list. Generates elements of a
list as are solicited so that just a little part of the list will need
to be in memory.  Uses nextval to replace the current element for the
next one.
